# So what does TensorFlow offer? Here’s a summary:
Its core is very similar to NumPy, but with GPU support.

It supports distributed computing (across multiple devices and servers).

It includes a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler that allows it to optimize computations for speed and memory usage. It works by extracting the computation graph from a Python function, optimizing it (e.g., by pruning unused nodes), and running it efficiently (e.g., by automatically running independent operations in parallel)

Computation graphs can be exported to a portable format, so you can train a TensorFlow model in one environment (e.g., using Python on Linux) and run it in another (e.g., using Java on an Android device).
