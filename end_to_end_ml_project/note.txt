# Asynchronous and Synchronous
The terms synchronous and asynchronous describe how tasks, processes, or communications are coordinated in time. Here's a clear breakdown.

# Synchronous (Sync)
Definition: Tasks or events happen one after another, in a strict sequence. Each task waits for the previous one to finish before starting.

Key idea: Do it now, wait for it to finish.

# Asynchronous (Async)
Definition: Tasks or events can happen independently, without waiting for other tasks to complete. The program or system can continue doing other work while waiting for a task to finish.

Key idea: Start it, and come back when it's done.

# Pipelines
A sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are very common in Machine Learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and many data transformations to apply.

# Cross-validation (CV)
Cross-validation (CV) in machine learning is a model evaluation technique used to estimate how well a model will perform on unseen data. Instead of training and testing the model on a single split of the data, cross-validation reuses the data multiple times in different train/test splits to get a more reliable performance estimate.
    Basic idea
        Split the dataset into multiple parts
        Train the model on some parts
        Test it on the remaining part
        Repeat the process several times
        Average the results

Scikit-Learn’s API is remarkably well designed. The main design principles are:17
• Consistency. All objects share a consistent and simple interface:
    # Estimators
    Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset is called an estimator (e.g., an imputer is an estimator). The estimation itself is performed by the fit() method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or two for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the labels).

    # Transformers
    Some estimators (such as an imputer) can also transform a dataset; these are called transformers. Once again, the API is quite simple: the transformation is performed by the transform() method with the dataset to transform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset.

    # Predictors
    Finally, some estimators are capable of making predictions given a dataset; they are called predictors. For example, the LinearRegression model in the previous chapter was a predictor: it predicted life satisfaction given a country’s GDP per capita.
